'When we''re out in a crowd, laughing loud
And nobody knows why
When we''re lost at a club, getting drunk
And you give me that smile
Going home in the back of a car
And your hand touches mine
When we''re done making love and you look up
And give me those eyes
''Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we''re apart and I''m missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
When you call me at night
While you''re out getting high with your friends
(High with your friends)
Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you''ve ever said
(You''ve ever said)
''Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we''re apart and I''m missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
When we''re done making love
And you look up and give me those eyes
''Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we''re apart and I''m missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
All the small things you do', 221, '2024-10-04', '1')
